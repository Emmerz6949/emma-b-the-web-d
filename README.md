You can use the commits to follow my journey.



### How did I do it?

I used HTML to create the elements for all 4 html files. I utilized Bootstrap and/or CSS to style all elements. And I used Bootsrap's JavaScript, jQuery, Popper.js, as they are required for certain Bootstrap components to function.

If you wish to visit this website you can do so via this link: https://emmerz6949.github.io/emma-b-the-web-d/ .



### Installation and Usage

There isn't anything to install as this is just a website that has been deployed.

To use my portfolio site click on the link in the "How did I do it?" section of this README.md, once the website loads use the navigation bar to peruse the website and click some buttons when buttons are available. 



### Credits

Some of the styling and all of the JavaScript was thanks to the power of Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/).

JavaScript Libraries Used (by Bootstrap): jQuery (https://api.jquery.com/) and Popper.js (https://popper.js.org/).
